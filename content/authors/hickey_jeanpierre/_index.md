bio: Dr. Jean-Pierre Hickey is an Assistant Professor in Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. He is drawn to the study of complex, multi-physics fluid problems involving the strong coupling of thermodynamics, acoustics, chemical kinetics, and, almost invariably, turbulence. These tightly-coupled problems are studied in the context of aerospace and aeronautical applications.
