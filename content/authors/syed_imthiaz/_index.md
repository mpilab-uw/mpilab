Imthiaz Syed is a MASc student working at the Multi-Physics Interaction Lab (MPILab) at the University of Waterloo, Canada. His research focusses on studying the key assumptions in near-wall turbulence to more accurately predict aerothermal heating in high-speed flows. He is particularly interested in understanding compressible axis-symmetric boundary layer theory, and the implementation of compressible scaling laws. Recently his work is focussed on the quantification of numerical and modelling errors in supersonic cooled-wall boundary layer flows, in both open-source and commercial RANS solvers.
